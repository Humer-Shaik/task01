# task01



Imports Libraries: The code starts by importing essential libraries for data manipulation (pandas) and plotting (matplotlib).
Loads Data: It reads a CSV file containing population data for various countries and years (replace '/content/population.csv' with the actual path to your data file). It also specifies 'utf-8' encoding to handle potential character encoding issues.
Data Cleaning: The code cleans the data by removing unnecessary columns like 'Country Code', 'Indicator Name', and 'Indicator Code'.
Selects Country: It allows you to choose a specific country (currently set to 'United States') for further analysis.
Extracts Data: The script extracts data for the chosen country, including years and their corresponding population values.
Visualizes Population Growth: It creates a bar chart to visualize the population of the chosen country across the years. The chart is labeled with a title, x-axis for years, and y-axis for population.
Population Distribution: An additional histogram plot is generated to show the distribution of the population values.
How to Use:

Save the code as a Python script (e.g., population_visualization.py).
Ensure you have pandas and matplotlib libraries installed (pip install pandas matplotlib).
Replace '/content/population.csv' with the path to your CSV file containing population data.
You can modify the chosen_country variable to visualize data for a different country present in your dataset.
Run the script using python population_visualization.py.
This will generate two visualizations:

A bar chart showing the population of the chosen country over the years.
A histogram depicting the distribution of population values.
